##Second week at RedHat
so far today i have just done a recap on last weeks work and i am now shawdowing my buddy Jameel and her team.Her work looks so complicated and frustrating:)
After we finished our shadowing session we went for lunch then had another session with Jameel about UI(User Interface)and UX(User Experience).We had a look at our horrible school website and then discussed how we could improve it.During my spare time i did the CodeAcademy HTML course and i feel like i learned alot from it and overall i am happy with the day:)
