    <p>Talion was the next to fall to the Black Hand's blade, but instead of dying, he found himself banished from death and bound to an Elven wraith, Celebrimbor. The two inhabited Talion's body, and Talion found himself denied the peace of the afterlife with his family. Seeking revenge against Sauron and the three servants who murdered his family (the Hammer, the Tower, and the Black Hand), Talion and Celebrimbor fought a guerilla war against the Orcs of Mordor, avenged Talion's family, and fought Sauron to a standstill.<br></p>
    
    <p>Last of the House of Fëanor, Celebrimbor (“hand of silver“ in Sindarin) was the greatest of the Elven craftsmen, responsible for crafting the Rings of Power. Working with Sauron, Celebrimbor made sixteen great rings for the Men and Dwarves. Without Sauron's knowledge he made three more rings for the Elves, yet he was deceived by Sauron, who had crafted the One Ring to dominate the other rings.Sauron then captured Celebrimbor and directed him to further perfect the One Ring, inscribing it with Tengwar script. Realizing the scope of Sauron's ambition, Celebrimbor escaped with the One Ring.Using the One Ring's power to raise an army of Uruks, Celebrimbor fought Sauron for dominance over Mordor. In a titanic battle against Sauron, Celebrimbor defeated the Dark Lord but lost the One Ring when it slipped off his finger and onto Sauron's before the killing blow. In revenge, Sauron murdered Celebrimbor's family before his eyes, then killed Celebrimbor with his own smithing hammer. But with Celebrimbor's fate bound to the One Ring, he was doomed to remain a wraith until the One Ring is unmade.<br></p>
    
    
    
    <p>Second Captain Idril is a shieldmaiden and the only child of Minas Ithil's military leader, General Castamir. She is a trained soldier defending against the Witch-king's siege and is eager to prove herself in battle. Idril is strong willed, proud, and very conscious of coming from a military family that has served Minas Ithil for generations. She has trained all her life, but the Siege of Minas Ithil is her first true experience of war. She considers herself a custodian of the city and its foremost historian.Idril's mother died during an Orc raid when Idril was only 11, so Idril has mostly had to raise herself. This has made her self-sufficient and relentless in pursuit of her goals. As an adolescent, her goal was to avenge her mother, and she repeatedly slipped into Cirith Ungol to attack Orc encampments. After growing weary of Gondorian patrols returning his daughter to safety, Castamir enrolled Idril in the military so she'd have a fighting chance when she inevitably sought Orcs to slay.Before the Siege of Minas Ithil, she spent much of her free time cataloging the vast collection of artifacts in Minas Ithil's Great Hall. She is familiar with its treasures, though the workings of some, like the Palantír, remain mysterious to her.</p>
